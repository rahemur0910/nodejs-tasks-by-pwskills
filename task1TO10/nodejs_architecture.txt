Node.js Architecture:

Node.js follows a single-threaded event-driven architecture that uses non-blocking I/O operations, making it efficient for handling concurrent connections. 
It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google, which compiles JavaScript code into native machine code. 
Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, allowing it to process multiple requests concurrently without creating new threads for each request. 
This architecture makes Node.js suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.
