In this coding challenge, your task is to create a package&json file for your project using the npm init
command& The package&json file is essential for managing dependencies, scripts, and other project"related
details& Below is the expected folder structure&

R% In the same project directory created in the above assignment, your task is to create a new file index&js and
using the fs module add information about Node&js architecture to a new file nodejs_architecture&txt& Below
are the expected files in the project folder&

Y% Continuing assignment 2& Here, let’s create a new file named index&js and use the fs module to read the
content of nodejs_architecture&txt and print the content to the console&

% In this coding challenge, you will continue working with the file created in the previous assignments& Here
your task is to access the existing nodejs_architecture&txt file and use the fs module to append additional
data to it& Specifically, add some advantages of Node&js to the file and print the file content to the console&

% To wind up the fs module walk"through challenges, let’s delete the nodejs_architecture&txt file& On deletion
print "File Deleted SuccessFully" to the console%
% Assume a situation where our server restricts access to its configuration via the user interface& The only way
to obtain the OS and release information is through a programmatic approach& In this challenge, you are
expected to use the os module and print the os name and the os"release version to the console&
Assignment

Full Stack Web Development

?0 In this challenge, you are required to use Node1js and the built-in HTTP module to create a server that
displays the text "I Am Happy To Learn Full Stack Web Development From PW Skills!" on the browser screen1
The goal is to utilize the HTTP module to create an HTTP server, set the port, appropriate content type, and
send the message as a response to the client's request, allowing it to display on the browser1

F0 Let's simulate a subscription feature similar to YouTube1 Using the events module, we'll create a custom
event named "subscribe"1 When this event is triggered, it should display a message in the console indicating
that the user has subscribed1

0 While working with the events module, one interesting observation is that when an event is created and
called, the associated event handler is triggered1 However, what happens if we remove an event and then
try to call it? In this coding challenge letes create an event handler and call it1 Later letes remove the event
handler and observe what happens when we call it0
du0 In continuation of the 8th question, let's now explore the concept of the maximum number of listeners
allowed for event handlers1 For this coding challenge, your task is to determine the current maximum
number of event listeners associated with an event and then set the maximum number of event listeners to
51 Note that the default maximum number of listeners might vary1 Your task is to limit the number of listeners
to 51
